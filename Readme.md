This dashboard was designed for **Job Seekers, Career Transitioners, and Professionals exploring new opportunities** to address a common challenge: information about the data job market is fragmented and difficult to analyze. 

By leveraging a dataset of 2024 data-related job postings (covering job titles, salaries, and locations), the project consolidates this information into a single interactive platform that highlights market trends and compensation insights.

### Dashboard File
The Power BI file for the dashboard can be found here: [Power_BI_Job_Market_Dashboard.pbix](Power_BI_Job_Market_Dashboard.pbix).
